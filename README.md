# Thesis for Master on Free Software Sciences and Technologies

Written in [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) in 2009, published in 2016 to be used as hints for people starting with Sphinx!

The SANET project mentioned in the project work was released with GPL to http://sanet.sourceforge.net

I don't know if now it is still available as Free Software or not
